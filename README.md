# OpenFoodFacts-Data-Analysis

Thanks to OpenClassroom Training Courses. I was able to produce this work mentored by Harrazi Geoffrey. I worked on this project for 8 weeks.

The goal of this project is to use this dataset to produce a final tool able to help customers. I chose to make a ranking app that permits the user to rank products by many filters. You can find the detailled process of exploration, cleaning, filtering and dynamic ranking in the Technical Notebook folder. I also made another notebook supposed to be rendered using the Voila python module (converting notebook in web page). For this one, I used the ipywidgets module to make an interactive interface.

-   __Next step :__ Hosting it on a web to make it accessible from an url.
-   __Current step :__ My notebook is too heavy for a https://mybinder.org/ hosting so I will have to use Azure services and integrate it using Docker. But first, I need to make it run on docker locally.
